Instagram follower Chrome Extension

very simple macro to Follow anyone on instagram, use with random interval so it looks like normal user's activity
you can set min-max interval between follow action( in seconds ), to make it more random, you should keep interval between 5-30.

this script will only follow accounts who meets the specified criteria, with minimal posts, minimal followers, minimal following, or whether it's private account or not.

the extension may not work in the future if Instagram changes their layout, in this case, you should subscribe my channel to get an update for the new script
Or You can watch my youtube video how to do that.
